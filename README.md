What happens when you have a party, roadtrip, or other event where you will be playing music where you want to give other people the option to add a song of their choice to the queue. Similar to a jukebox at a dinner or bar, users can add songs into the queue and if there are no party songs in the queue, spotify will shuffle the music as normal.

There will be separate rooms set up for every website user and the ability to share and close your own party room which will let peopl add their songs to your queue.
